What is “git cherry-pick”?

The command git cherry-pick enables you to pick up commits from a branch within a repository and apply it to another branch. This command is useful to undo changes
when any commit is accidentally made to the wrong branch. Then, you can switch to the correct branch and use this command to cherry-pick the commit.

There are two commands to determine these two different things.

git branch --merged - Returns the list of branches that have been merged into the current branch.

git branch --no-merged - Returns the list of branches that have not been merged.
